#Testing

Testing Documentation Can Be Found in the `TestingDocumentation.ods` file. This lists the Unit Tests run and thier
results. To view logs from the execution of those tests see the `testlog` folder and then within there the folder
that corresponds with the tests' id number as specified in the doc.

#Log File Notes
Note that some folders are missing as testing was inconclusive due to time factor in executing the test.

Also at the end of each log file you may see that it appears to error. This is not an actual error but the nature of
the emulator begining taken down. All components are interdependent on eachother and a dropped conneciton does not always
get caught.
